        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
        <p>
            "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn’t make a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn good cup of coffee. Starbuzz’s
            CEO is that man, and you already know his plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
        </p>
        <p>
            In only a few years he’s executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere. And, of course, the big
            news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz’s Web presence, which is
            growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of customers.
