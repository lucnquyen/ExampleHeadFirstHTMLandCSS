    <h2>July 14, 2005</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote> Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</blockquote> I definetely won't be passing
        any car.

    <p>
        My first day of the trip! I can’t believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I’m on a Segway, I wasn’t
        able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>Cellphone</li>
            <li>IPod</li>
            <li>Digital camera</li>
            <li>A protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
