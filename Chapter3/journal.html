    <p>
        Well i made it 1200 miles already, and my pass,
        through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla,
        WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Whhy,
        AZ, and Truth or Consequences, NM.

    <h2>July 14, 2005</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the 
        road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get
        you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definetely won't be 
        passing any car.

        My first day of the trip! I can’t believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. Because I’m on a Segway,
        I wasn’t able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod,
        digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
        Lao Tzu would have said, “A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one Segway.”
